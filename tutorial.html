<p>In this tutorial we will explore the design and generation of Alien Miner, a physics-based platformer game. The main actor of the game is an adventurous alien whose primary mission is to collect precious gems while exploring the galaxy. In this version of Alien Miner the main actor of the game is found inside a cave with hidden treasures and dangerous meteorites. The goal of the game is to guide the alien through the cave and collect all the gems found in it. The alien should avoid all meteorites at all cost.
In Alien Miner, for every emerald and diamond collected the player will receive 20 and 30 points respectively. While emeralds are collected when the alien touches them, diamonds are collected when the player taps on their screen position. If the alien gets hit by a meteorite, the player will lose 20 points. The game has a total duration of 120 seconds. However, if the player reaches the teleportation portal at the need of the level the game will come to an end.</p>

<p>In this instance of Alien Miner the main actor of the game is controlled using on-screen controls, i.e. three buttons specify the vertical and horizontal acceleration of the alien. Let us briefly guide you through the development process for this game using PhyDSL.</p> <br>

<p>The first step in the creation of a game with PhyDSL is the creation of a gameplay design file.  To begin, you need to open your Eclipse distribution with the PhyDSL and Android Development Tools plugins. If you have not yet installed any of the plugins, please go to the download section in this site.</p>

<p>1. On a clean workspace right click on ‘package explorer’ > New > Project ... > General > Project > Next > give the project a name such as ‘AlienMiner’ > Click Finish.</p>


<p>2. Create an empty folder in the root of the newly created folder, with a name such as ‘games’</p>

<p>3. Create a PhyDSL gameplay design file: right click on the empty folder > New> File> give the file a name such as AlienMiner.phy. It is important that all the game definition files have the .phy extension in order for the PhyDSL plugin to recognize them. </p>

<p>4. If this is your first time creating a .phy file, Eclipse will display a dialog asking if you want to switch to an XText perspective > Click Yes. </p>

<p>In order to create a game definition file you first need to choose all the graphical and sound artifacts that will be part of your game. This includes all the skins for the actors of the game, the game sound effects, and its background image. In order to manage memory more efficiently you can split large background images into slices of equal size. It is important to mention that the name of the slices should include a consecutive number index, like in the example below. Later in this tutorial we will explain how slices can be used in order to create a memory efficient game. All the artifacts need to be stored in the “artifacts” directory of the generator. If you have not downloaded the PhyDSL generator please go to the download page in this site.</p>
