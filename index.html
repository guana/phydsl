<p>PhyDSL, a game engine and game authoring environment for mobile 2D physics-based games. PhyDSL consists of a textual domain-specific language for gameplay design, and a generation engine capable of taking high-level gameplay specifications and translating them into executable code for Android devices. PhyDSL has been developed by <a href="http://victorguana.blogspot.ca/">Victor Guana</a>  at the University of Alberta, and it is a successful case study on building complex software systems using model-driven engineering technologies.</p>

<p>The most recent release of PhyDSL includes complex camera behaviours, flexible on screen controls, and optimized memory management for large game world/spaces.</p>

<p>PhyDSL  is built on top of the <a href="http://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> physics engine with a flexible Java/Android architecture. PhyDSL-2 is comprised by two main components: a self-contained code generator built-in <a href="https://eclipse.org/atl/">ATL</a> and <a href="https://eclipse.org/acceleo/">Acceleo</a> model-transformation technolgoies, and an Eclipse plug-in that enables developers to specify game play designs using a textual syntax delectated editor built using XText.</p>

<p> Game-construction engines enable developers to reuse assets from previously developed games, thus easing the software-engineering challenges around the video-game development experience and making the implementation of games less expensive, less technologically brittle, and more efficient. However, the construction of game engines is challenging in itself; it involves the specification of well defined architectures and typical gameplay behaviors, flexible enough to enable game designers to implement their vision, while, at the same time, simplifying the implementation through asset and code reuse. In this paper we present a set of lessons learned through the design and construction </p>

<p>PhyDSL-2, a game engine for 2D physics-based games. Our experience involves the active use of modern model-driven engineering technologies, to overcome the complexity of the engine design and to systematize its maintenance and evolution.</p>
