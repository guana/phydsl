<p>PhyDSL, a game engine and game authoring environment for the creation of mobile physics-based games in 2D. PhyDSL consists of a textual domain-specific language for gameplay design, and a generation engine capable of taking high-level gameplay specifications and translating them into executable code for Android devices. </p>

<p>PhyDSL introduces new generative capabilities for more complex gameplay designs. The new release includes complex actor behaviors, flexible on screen controls, different camera features, and optimized memory management for large game world/spaces. PhyDSL is a successful case study on building complex software systems using model-driven engineering technologies.</p>

<p>PhyDSL  is built on top of the Box2D physics engine with a flexible Java/Android architecture. PhyDSL-2 is comprised by two main components: a self-contained code generator built-in ATL and Acceleo model-transformation technolgoies, and an Eclipse plug-in that enables developers to specify game play designs using a textual syntax delectated editor built using XText.</p>

<p> Game-construction engines enable developers to reuse assets from previously developed games, thus easing the software-engineering challenges around the video-game development experience and making the implementation of games less expensive, less technologically brittle, and more efficient. However, the construction of game engines is challenging in itself; it involves the specification of well defined architectures and typical gameplay behaviors, flexible enough to enable game designers to implement their vision, while, at the same time, simplifying the implementation through asset and code reuse. In this paper we present a set of lessons learned through the design and construction </p>

<p>PhyDSL-2, a game engine for 2D physics-based games. Our experience involves the active use of modern model-driven engineering technologies, to overcome the complexity of the engine design and to systematize its maintenance and evolution.</p>
